This project aims to predict customer churn using machine learning techniques. Churn prediction helps businesses identify customers who are likely to stop using their service, allowing them to take proactive measures to retain them.


ðŸ§° Tools & Libraries

Python
Pandas, NumPy
Scikit-learn
Matplotlib, Seaborn
RandomForest

ðŸ’¡ Key Insights

-> Tenure, monthly charges, and number of services significantly impact churn.
-> Customers with shorter tenure and higher charges are more likely to churn.

ðŸš€ Future Work

-> Deploy the model using Flask or Streamlit
-> Integrate with a dashboard for real-time predictions
-> Implement customer segmentation for targeted retention strategies
